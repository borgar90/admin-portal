# Future Tech Admin Panel CMS

Welcome to the **Future Tech Admin Panel CMS**, an innovative project designed to streamline the management of MongoDB collections and the dynamic generation of TypeScript models. This platform is specifically engineered for administrators and moderators who need a robust yet flexible interface to handle database schemas with ease.

## Project Overview

The Future Tech Admin Panel CMS provides a user-friendly interface to create and manage MongoDB collections directly from the web. It allows users to define collections, specify fields, and set data types, all through a visually engaging drag-and-drop interface. Each collection and its fields can be dynamically translated into TypeScript models, which are then used to ensure type safety throughout the application.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Schema Creation:** Users can define and modify MongoDB collections.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Generates TypeScript models automatically from collection definitions.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Simplifies the creation and configuration of data schemas.
- **No Authentication Required:** Simplifies initial setup and testing phases.

## Technologies

- **Frontend:** Next.js (TypeScript), Chakra UI
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Other Tools:** Axios for HTTP requests
